module assert_subroutine_m
  !! summary: Utility for runtime enforcement of logical assertions.
  !! usage: error-terminate if the assertion fails:
  !!
  !!    use assertions_m, only : assert
  !!    call assert( 2 > 1, "2 > 1")
  !!
  !! Assertion enforcement is controlled via the `ASSERTIONS` preprocessor macro,
  !! which can be defined to non-zero or zero at compilation time to
  !! respectively enable or disable runtime assertion enforcement.
  !!
  !! When the `ASSERTIONS` preprocessor macro is not defined to any value,
  !! the default is that assertions are *disabled* and will not check the condition.
  !!
  !! Disabling assertion enforcement may eliminate any associated runtime
  !! overhead by enabling optimizing compilers to ignore the assertion procedure
  !! body during a dead-code-removal phase of optimization.
  !!
  !! To enable assertion enforcement (e.g., for a debug build), define the preprocessor ASSERTIONS to non-zero.
  !! This file's capitalized .F90 extension causes most Fortran compilers to preprocess this file so
  !! that building as follows enables assertion enforcement: 
  !!
  !!    fpm build --flag "-DASSERTIONS"
  !!
