module assert_m
  !! summary: Utility for runtime checking of logical assertions.
  !! usage: error-terminate if the assertion fails:
  !!
  !!    use assertions_m, only : assert
  !!    call assert( 2 > 1, "2 > 1")
  !!
  !! Turn off assertions in production code by setting USE_ASSERTIONS to .false. via the preprocessor.
  !! This file's capitalized .F90 extension causes most Fortran compilers to preprocess this file so
  !! that building as follows turns off assertion enforcement: 
  !!
  !!    fpm build --flag "-DUSE_ASSERTIONS=.false."
  !!
  !! Doing so may eliminate any associated runtime overhead by enabling optimizing compilers to ignore
  !! the assertion procedure body during a dead-code-removal phase of optimization.
